# Localisation (L10n)
The Trello Power-Up client exposes a few methods to help with L10n, and takes care of loading resource files in the background, and using them to retrieve localised strings by key.

The official documentation is [here](https://developers.trello.com/reference/#localization).

## What do I need to provide?
Please open a PR including:
- A translation of the sentence: "Everything you need to conduct a Lean Coffee session!" (for the official Power-Up listing)
- `i18n/<languagetag>.yml`: a file containing translated strings (variable interpolations is supported; see existing translations). The filename must be a [BCP 47 language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag); since we only support localisation for languages Trello already supports, just switch to that language using Trello's own language selector, and then check the value of `window.locale` in the browser console: that will be your language tag;
- `i18n/listings/DESCRIPTION.<languagetag>.md`: a Markdown file containing the translated version of the Power-Up description, which will be displayed in the [official Power-Up listing](https://trello.com/power-ups/5d1249acb16eef6f790f2af9) - don't forget to update the links to the images, by replacing the language tag in the URL with your own (e.g. change `assets/listings/en` to `assets/listings/fr`);
- `tools/L10nImages/utils/SupportedLanguages.js`: modify this file to add a mapping between the language tag you used and the name of the language, as it appears in Trello's own language selector (it will be used by us to generate localised screenshots for the Power-Up listing)
